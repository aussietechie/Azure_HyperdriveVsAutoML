# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
Problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."

Solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
Info about pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.

What are the benefits of the parameter sampler chosen?

What are the benefits of the early stopping policy chosen?

## AutoML
Description of the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.

## Pipeline comparison
Comparison the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do I think there was one?

## Future work
What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?
